## Desarrollo

  ### 1) Theme selection and sources
  
    For this project the theme selected has been criptocurrencies research, as probably my bootcamp project will be focused to that matter.
    After some research the sources to be used will be Binance and CoinmarketCap, as they are top sources of information about this matter worldwide.

  ### 2) Data Extraction (Web Scrapping y API)
